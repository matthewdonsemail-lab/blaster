# Number pools

A pool is an ordered group of sending numbers worked one at a time, each inside
its own rate budget. Assigning a pool to a sequence makes the pool, not a fixed
`fromNumber`, decide which number sends each message. This page is written to
match the code: the tables, the selection rule, the status fields, and the four
surfaces that manage it.

## Why a pool exists

A carrier rate limit is scoped to a number. When a runner ignores that and keeps
handing one number more than it may send, the extra messages are pushed into the
carrier's limit queue rather than sent. The pool exists to make that impossible:
it sends only what a number's budget allows now and defers the rest to the
instant the pool is next able to send. Adding capacity is adding numbers, not
changing a sequence.

## The relationship

Two tables, in `convex/schema/pool.ts`:

```
poolNumbers (the relation)          pools
- poolId  ---------------> id (pools)
- phoneNumberId ---------> phoneNumbers.id
- phoneNumber      (E.164, denormalised)
- order            (sequential position)
- status           active | paused | removed
- sentToday
- dayStartedAt
- nextAvailableAt
- lastSentAt
- assignedAt
- removedAt
                                    - status            active | paused
                                    - strategy          sequential
                                    - cursor            last-used order
                                    - minSpacingMs
                                    - dailyCapPerNumber
                                    - activeNumberCount (rollup)
                                    - nextAvailableAt   (rollup)
                                    - lastDispatchedAt
```

A number is related to a pool through a `poolNumbers` row, not a `poolId` field
on `phoneNumbers`. That is deliberate: a membership has an `order` and its own
rate state, and a number can sit in more than one pool. The phone's identity and
purchase ledger stay on `phoneNumbers`; the pool owns membership, order, and
runtime state.

**The relational status is the `poolNumbers` row.** `status`, `sentToday`,
`dayStartedAt`, and `nextAvailableAt` are the fields that answer "what is this
number doing right now". The matching fields on `pools` are the rollup so a
status view is one read: `activeNumberCount` is how many members can send, and
`nextAvailableAt` is the earliest instant any of them can.

## The selection rule

`selectSender` in `packages/core/src/pipeline/pool/helpers/select.ts` is a pure
function, so the arithmetic is tested with no database:

- Start after `pools.cursor` and walk the active members in `order`, wrapping.
- A member may send when `nextAvailableAt <= now` and, if `dailyCapPerNumber > 0`,
  `sentToday < dailyCapPerNumber`.
- The first member that may send wins. If none may, the function returns the
  **soonest** instant any active member becomes available.

The runner uses this twice:

1. **Before claiming a step** it reads `availableSender` (no budget spent). If
   none may send now, it defers the enrollment to `soonestNextAvailableAt` with
   `lastSkipReason: "pool-rate-limited"`. If the pool has no active numbers at
   all it parks the enrollment `awaiting-human` with `lastSkipReason:
   "pool-empty"`. Neither case sends and neither drops the message.
2. **After the send rate limiter grants capacity** for the chosen number, it
   calls the internal `consumeSender` mutation with the `order` the read
   proposed. That mutation reserves *that* member — refusing and reporting the
   next slot if it is no longer available, rather than substituting another
   number — and spends its budget in one transaction: it increments `sentToday`,
   sets `nextAvailableAt = now + minSpacingMs`, advances `pools.cursor`, and
   refreshes the rollup. Read and write therefore agree: the number eligibility
   was evaluated against, the number the limiter charged, and the number the
   message leaves from are the same by construction. The step's claim is taken
   *last*, immediately before the send, so a deferral never leaves a claim
   behind.

## The pool and the send rate limiter

There are two rate authorities, and this is the relationship between them.

- **`convex/rateLimit.ts` is the admission control for every send**, pooled or
  not. `telnyxSend` is the account ceiling; `telnyxSendPerNumber` is a token
  bucket of one send per second per number (burst 3). It is checked and consumed
  in one transaction by `claimSendCapacity`.
- **The pool is the selection authority.** It decides *which* number sends, and
  paces with `minSpacingMs`, whose default is the limiter's own per-number period
  (`TELNYX_PER_NUMBER_PERIOD_MS`), so the two agree instead of competing.

The runner claims limiter capacity for the pool-chosen number, then reserves the
pool's own budget, then claims the step, then sends. The order matters:

- A limiter refusal defers the enrollment to `retryAfter`
  (`send-capacity-exhausted`) with no step claim taken, so the step actually
  retries next tick. A refusal never fails and never parks the enrollment.
- The pool's budget is reserved only *after* capacity is granted, so a refusal
  costs no number an allowance.
- The step claim is taken *last*, because `sequenceSendClaims` rows are never
  released: a claim taken before a deferral would strand that step as
  `already-claimed` forever. Claim-before-send still holds, because the claim is
  taken immediately before the provider call.

The limiter is load-bearing rather than belt-and-braces because of this repo's own
error handling: `classifySendResult` treats any 4xx, a 429 included, as a
definite failure with `retryable: false`, so an oversent 429 parks the enrollment
for a human instead of backing off. The cap has to prevent the 429; the pool must
not outrun it. Tuning either value is a change to this relationship, not to one
file.

## Managing a pool from a surface

Every pool capability exists on all three surfaces, and they all resolve to the
same Convex functions. The capabilities are registered in
`packages/blaster-cli/src/cli/index.ts` (`CAPABILITIES`), and
`scripts/check-surfaces.mjs` fails the build when a registered MCP tool or HTTP
route does not exist.

| Capability | CLI | MCP | HTTP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pools.new` | `blaster pool` | - | - |
| `pools.list` | `blaster pools list` | `blaster_list_pools` | `GET /api/pools` |
| `pools.get` | `blaster pools show <id>` | `blaster_get_pool` | `GET /api/pools/:id` |
| `pools.create` | `blaster pools create --name <name>` | `blaster_create_pool` | `POST /api/pools` |
| `pools.addNumber` | `blaster pools add-number --pool <id> --number <e164>` | `blaster_add_pool_number` | `POST /api/pools/:id/numbers` |
| `pools.removeNumber` | `blaster pools remove-number --pool <id> --number <e164>` | `blaster_remove_pool_number` | `DELETE /api/pools/:id/numbers/:phoneNumber` |
| `pools.reorder` | `blaster pools reorder --pool <id> --order <e164,...>` | `blaster_reorder_pool` | `PUT /api/pools/:id/numbers` |
| `sequences.setPool` | `blaster pools assign --sequence <id> --pool <id>` | `blaster_set_sequence_pool` | `POST /api/sequences/:id/pool` |

The HTTP routes are operator-gated (they name provisioned numbers and rate
state), and the CLI and MCP reach them through the shared
`createBlasterApiClient`, so the three cannot disagree about a payload. The
same routes are also registered on the Convex deployment's own HTTP router
(`convex/http/`), so a site with no Hono in front still answers them; the
OpenAPI spec at `openapi.yaml` (regenerate with `pnpm openapi`) describes the
Convex surface.

## Building a pool interactively

Run `blaster pool` in a terminal (the alias `blaster pools` behaves the same
with no action). It is behind the same login gate as the other operator
commands: without a session it says to run `blaster login` rather than
prompting. The wizard, over `@clack/prompts`:

1. **Name the pool** (`--name` skips the prompt).
2. **Pick the numbers** from the workspace's sendable numbers in one
   multi-select. A number with no messaging profile is not offered.
3. **Optionally assign the pool to a sequence**, chosen from the stored
   sequences, or answer "Do not assign".

```text
blaster pool
```

A cancel at any prompt stops the command and names what was left unchanged; it
never creates half a pool. The flags on `blaster pools create` /
`add-number` / `assign` are the non-interactive path for scripts and CI, and are
what the MCP tools call.

## How a number is removed from a pool

Removal is a **soft** removal. `convex/pool/mutations.ts`:

1. Resolve the phone number to a `phoneNumbers` row, then to its `poolNumbers`
   membership by the `poolPhoneNumber` index.
2. Patch the membership to `status: "removed"` with `removedAt`.
3. Compact the remaining live memberships so `order` stays contiguous, and move
   `pools.cursor` with them to the same member's new position (or to the member
   below the removed one), so dispatch still resumes where it left off.
4. Refresh the pool rollup in the same transaction.

It is not a delete because an in-flight send may already have chosen that number,
and because the record that the number was in the pool is worth keeping. Removing
the last active number is allowed; the runner parks the affected enrollment
`awaiting-human` rather than sending into an empty pool, which is visible and
recoverable instead of a silent stall.

To remove, from any surface:

```bash
blaster pools remove-number --pool <pool-id> --number +15551234567
```

## Scaling

Add a number to raise capacity:

```bash
blaster pools add-number --pool <pool-id> --number +15557654321
```

It is appended to `order`; dispatch naturally spreads across the larger pool.
The sequence is not touched. The order can be reset at any time with
`blaster pools reorder`.

## Wiring a pool to the sequencer

```bash
blaster pools assign --sequence <sequence-id> --pool <pool-id>
```

This writes `sequences.poolId`. A sequence with a pool takes its sending number
from `consumeSender` per send; a sequence without one keeps its fixed
`fromNumber`, so existing behaviour is unchanged. Omit `--pool` to clear the
assignment. The runner and its rate-limit behaviour are described in
[sequencer.md](sequencer.md).

## Inbound

Pools rotate numbers, so the inbound path has to stop assuming one sending
number per sequence. Four things move through it:

- **Ownership.** A verified webhook is stored only if the `to` number is in a
  registry we control. There are three (`packages/core/src/telnyx/messaging/helpers/ownership.ts`):
  the Telnyx account, the Twenty `agencyPhones` mirror, and the Convex purchase
  ledger. The ledger is the one a pool can populate before a sync, so the API's
  ownership check reads it (`listLedgerNumbers`) — otherwise a reply to a number
  owned only in Convex would be refused as not-owned and dropped.
- **A reply stops the sequence.** `recordInboundMessage` stores the message and
  calls `stopEnrollmentsForPeer` in the same transaction. That stop matches on
  the peer alone, not on the number, so a reply on any pool number stops every
  active enrollment for that person — which is what `stopOnReply` means. The
  runner's own reply re-check (`loadRunContext`) is likewise peer-wide now: it
  reads every thread the peer has, because a pool sequence has no one pair to
  key on.
- **Campaign attribution.** The inbox resolves a thread's campaign with
  `campaignFor`, which matches a sequence whose `poolId` owns the thread's
  `blasterNumber`. Without this, every pool-backed thread shows as `unassigned`.
  A pool with one number that is also fixed elsewhere is still attributed.
- **Threads are per number.** A contact reached from three pool numbers has
  three conversations, because a conversation is keyed on `(peer,
  blasterNumber)`. The campaign grouping reunites them under one campaign, but
  the default inbox shows one row per number.
- **The inbox can fold per person.** `listConversations` takes `groupBy:
  "person"` (MCP `blaster_list_conversation_persons`, `GET /api/conversations?groupBy=person`,
  `blaster inbox list --person`), which returns one row per person listing the
  numbers they were reached from, with the person's campaign as the union of
  their threads' campaigns (`multiple` when they differ). Storage is unchanged:
  the per-number threads stay the record, and the fold is a read.

Closed: the durable per-peer suppression now exists — `convex/suppressions/`,
keyed on the E.164 peer, written by the inbound opt-out, and checked at enroll
and at send. An operator lifts it explicitly; until then no sequence can reach
the person.
