# Convex naming and directory conventions

A project-agnostic convention for organising a Convex backend. It has three
parts that must not be confused:

- **Framework requirements** (F-rules): imposed by Convex. Violate them and the
  deploy breaks. The gate does not need to enforce most of these — the
  framework already does, loudly, at `convex dev` time.
- **Repository rules** (R-rules): imposed by us, enforced by the `check:convex`
  gate. Violate them and the pre-push hook fails.
- **Recommendations** (G-rules, for *guidance*): documented judgment calls the
  gate deliberately does not check, because they need a human to evaluate them.

Each rule is labelled with which part it belongs to and why it exists. A rule
that guesses at intent would be brittle, so anything the gate cannot check
objectively lives in G, never in R.

## Framework requirements (Convex imposes these)

These come from the Convex documentation and the CLI bundled with the
`convex` package. They are not negotiable and the lint gate does not need to
enforce them — the framework already does, loudly, at `convex dev` time.

### F1. The backend lives in `convex/`
`convex dev` pushes the contents of the `convex/` directory to the deployment
and derives types from it. ([Workflow](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/workflow))

### F2. *When* a schema is defined, it lives at `convex/schema.ts` with a default export
Convex applications may run without an explicitly defined schema. When a
schema is defined, it is declared in a `schema.ts` file in the `convex/`
directory with `export default defineSchema({...})`, and codegen imports that
module to produce `dataModel.d.ts`. ([Schemas](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas),
[schema.ts config](https://docs.convex.dev/config/schema.ts))

Because this repository uses schema validation, the gate treats a root
`schema.ts` with a default export as a **repository requirement** (see R10),
not as a universal framework mandate. A schemaless Convex project would not
need it.

### F3. File path plus export name is the function address
Queries, mutations, and actions are defined in TypeScript files inside
`convex/`. The path and name of the file, plus the way the function is
exported, determine the name clients use: `convex/foo/myQueries.ts` exporting
`listMessages` is called as `api.foo.myQueries.listMessages`. A default export
is addressed as `default`. ([Query functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions))

Consequences that matter for everything below:
- Moving a function file **renames its public address**. A restructure is an
  API migration and every `api.*` / `internal.*` call site must move with it.
- Two modules exporting the same function name create **two addresses**. A
  barrel that re-exports a Convex function does not alias it — it duplicates
  it. Never re-export a function through an index file.

### F4. Nested directories namespace the API
Subdirectories under `convex/` are supported and become API namespaces, as in
`api.foo.myQueries.listMessages`. ([Query functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions))

### F5. `convex/http.ts` owns HTTP routes via a default-exported router
HTTP endpoints are defined with `httpRouter` + `httpAction` and the file
default-exports the router. Route `path` is the exact URL path. ([HTTP actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions))

### F6. `convex/crons.ts` owns scheduled jobs
Cron jobs are defined in a `crons.ts` file with `cronJobs()`. Cron targets must
be function references. ([Cron jobs](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs))

### F7. `convex/_generated/` is machine output
Codegen writes it on every `convex dev` run. Check it in so the tree typechecks
without a running daemon, and never edit it by hand. ([Best practices](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/))

### F8. `convex/convex.config.ts` is a framework entrypoint with a fixed filename
The place for installing components (`app.use(...)`) and framework-level
configuration such as environment variables. ([convex.config.ts](https://docs.convex.dev/config/convex.config.ts))

## Repository conventions (we impose these on ourselves)

Convex enforces nothing about case style — its own examples mix cases in one
tree — so the style rules below are ours. They exist so a reader can tell what
kind of thing a name is without opening the file.

### R1. Filesystem naming: camelCase for everything multi-word inside `convex/` [enforced]
File and directory names use camelCase: `phoneNumbers.ts`, `sequence/`,
`recordInboundMessage` as an export name. Single-word names stay lowercase:
`schema.ts`, `http.ts`, `queries.ts`. The gate checks this rule.

Why camelCase rather than the kebab-case used elsewhere in this repo: the
function address *is* the file path (F3), so the file name is a public API
surface, and the framework's own examples and generated paths use camelCase.
Fighting that inside `convex/` would mean fighting the tool. The boundary is
the directory: kebab-case outside, camelCase inside.

### R2. Database naming: tables, fields, and indexes in camelCase [documented, not gated]
Tables are camelCase plural nouns (`sequenceEnrollments`, not
`sequence_enrollments` or `SequenceEnrollment`); fields are plain camelCase
keys, which Convex derives TypeScript types from directly, so the casing
flows end to end. The gate does not check this — it cannot tell a table name
from any other string without parsing TypeScript, and a naming gate should not
pretend to be a compiler.

### R3. Index names mirror the indexed field path [documented, not gated]
An index on `["providerEventId"]` is named `"providerEventId"`. Compound
indexes join with nothing added. To be explicit: Convex places no semantic
requirement on index names beyond uniqueness within the table — its own
documentation uses names like `by_channel` — so this is purely our convention,
chosen so the name tells you exactly what the index serves without opening
the schema. The gate does not check it, for the same reason as R2.

### A note on what follows (R4–R7)
Convex does not require any particular directory layout. Its own best-practices
page recommends thin public function wrappers over shared helper logic, but not
this exact structure — the layout below is this repository's architecture, not
a framework mandate. ([Best practices](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/))

### R4. One domain per directory; one function kind per file
```
convex/
├── schema.ts            # index only: spreads schema/<domain>.ts (R6)
├── http.ts              # index only: registers http/<domain>.ts (R7)
├── crons.ts             # cron registrations only, targets internal.* (F6)
├── schema/
│   └── <domain>.ts      # table definitions for one domain, no functions
├── http/
│   └── <domain>.ts      # route registrations for one domain, no handlers inline
└── <domain>/
    ├── types.ts         # (optional) validators and the types derived from them (R11)
    ├── utils.ts         # (optional) pure functions: no ctx, no db, no I/O (R11)
    ├── helpers.ts       # (optional) context-bound reads, called by queries.ts (R11)
    ├── model.ts         # context-bound logic: takes ctx, calls core helpers, writes nothing else
    ├── queries.ts       # thin wrappers over model.ts and helpers.ts
    ├── mutations.ts     # thin wrappers over model.ts
    ├── actions.ts       # external side effects only (network, AI); no db writes
    ├── workflow.ts      # durable execution; deterministic body, I/O only inside steps
    └── index.ts         # barrel: types and constants only, never functions (R12)
```

Only create the files a domain needs. A domain with no external calls has no
`actions.ts`; a domain with no long-lived process has no `workflow.ts`; a domain
whose argument validators live inline in its function files has no `types.ts`.
The four primitives in R11 are exempt from that judgement call: `types.ts` and
`index.ts` are required for every domain, `utils.ts` and `helpers.ts` are not.

### R5. Function files are boundaries; `model.ts` holds reusable domain logic
`queries.ts`, `mutations.ts`, and `actions.ts` are Convex function boundary
modules. They keep framework-specific concerns close to the wrapper —
argument validation, transaction and execution boundaries, index selection —
while reusable context-bound domain logic belongs in `model.ts`. Pure domain
decisions (eligibility, arithmetic, time math) belong in the shared core
library where they are unit-testable without a database; `model.ts` takes
`ctx`, asks core to decide, and persists the answer.

This is deliberately not a rule that every handler contain exactly one model
call. That would be an artificial requirement the implementation does not
follow, and a convention stricter than its codebase is a convention nobody
trusts. The goal is thin function boundaries, not one-line handlers: a reader
should be able to see what a function does without scrolling, and anything
bigger than that belongs in `model.ts` or core.

This mirrors the framework's own recommended shape — "most of your code
should live in a model directory, with very short public functions that
mostly just call into it" ([Best practices](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/)).

### R6. Root `schema.ts` composes; it defines nothing
```ts
import { defineSchema } from "convex/server";
import { userTables } from "./schema/users.js";

export default defineSchema({ ...userTables });
```
Table definitions live in `schema/<domain>.ts` (or `<domain>/schema.ts`
re-exported through it). The root file owns no tables directly, so growing
the schema never means editing a file everything imports. This is plain
TypeScript composition around the framework's root-schema contract (F2).

### R7. Root `http.ts` registers; it handles nothing
```ts
import { httpRouter } from "convex/server";
import { registerUserRoutes } from "./http/users.js";

const http = httpRouter();
registerUserRoutes(http);
export default http;
```
Each `http/<domain>.ts` exports a `register*Routes(http)` function and owns
its route definitions and HTTP handlers. Handlers stay small and delegate to
mutations and actions for anything beyond reading the request and shaping the
response; a route handler must not contain business logic. The rule is about
the root file — `convex/http.ts` registers and handles nothing — not about
pushing every line out of the domain modules.

### R8. Internal calls use `internal.*`, never `api.*`
Any `runQuery`, `runMutation`, `runAction`, or scheduler target inside
`convex/` — including cron targets (F6) — must reference `internal.*`
functions. To be precise about why: calling a public function does not bypass
that function's own access controls, so this is not a framework restriction.
It is a security-oriented project convention — backend-only calls, and
scheduled calls in particular, should target functions that are not
client-reachable, so a future change to a public function's exposure cannot
silently widen what the backend itself can invoke. The framework's own
best-practices page recommends the same split. ([Best practices](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/))

One documented exception: the deployment's own HTTP router (`convex/http.ts`
and the `convex/http/` domain groups) reaches the public functions it serves
through `api.*`. The router is itself the public surface of a Convex
deployment — a site with no Hono in front still answers on it — and its
handlers exist to call those public functions. The convention is still
enforced everywhere else in the tree; `check:convex` exempts the `http/`
directory only.

### R9. No function re-exports through barrels
Do not use barrel files to re-export Convex functions. Convex discovers
exported functions by module path (F3), so re-exporting functions can create
additional API surfaces and makes the function address harder to reason about.
Function modules are imported directly by path. Barrels may re-export *types
and constants only*, with explicit `export type`, never values that could be
function references.

### R10. This repository defines a schema, so root `schema.ts` is required
Per F2, a schema itself is optional in Convex. This repository uses schema
validation, so a root `schema.ts` with a default export is required here.
A project without schema validation would not need this rule.

### R11. Domain primitives: types, utils, helpers, and one definition per shape
Each domain owns four primitives with distinct responsibilities. The point of
separating them is that each one has a dependency direction, so a reader can
tell from the imports alone what a file is allowed to know:

| File | Owns | May import |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `types.ts` | Argument validators and the types derived from them with `Infer` | `convex/values`, pure core types |
| `utils.ts` | Pure functions: no `ctx`, no database, no I/O | core, `types.ts` |
| `helpers.ts` | Context-bound **reads** | `_generated` types, `utils.ts`, `types.ts` |
| `model.ts` | Context-bound **writes** and domain transitions | `_generated` types, `utils.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `types.ts`, core |

Three rules make this worth having:

1. **A validator is defined once.** A field shape that appears in a schema, an
   action argument, and a helper signature is declared once in `types.ts` and
   imported everywhere else. `Infer<typeof validator>` gives the TypeScript
   type, so the validator and its type cannot drift apart — there is no second
   union to keep in sync.
2. **No inline type or cast where a name exists.** If a function file needs a
   union, an argument object, or a return shape, it imports the name from
   `types.ts`. An inline `as` cast at a call site is the signal that a type is
   missing, not a way to make it compile. Where a Convex type and a core type
   must agree, they are checked by a compile-time equality assertion rather than
   by a comment asking someone to remember.
3. **`helpers.ts` holds the read logic, and `queries.ts` stays a boundary.**
   Convex actions have no direct database access, so a runner action *must*
   reach data through `ctx.runQuery`. That is a platform constraint, not a
   design smell, and the response is one thin query over logic in `helpers.ts`
   — not the read logic inlined into the action, and not `helpers.ts` reaching
   for `ctx.db` from somewhere it cannot.

### R12. The domain barrel re-exports types and constants, never functions
Every domain has an `index.ts` that is the domain's public interface for
anything that is not a Convex function:

```ts
export { enrollmentStatusValidator } from "./types.js";
export type { EnrollmentStatus, ApplyScheduleArgs } from "./types.js";
```

Rules, in order of severity:

- **No `export *`.** Star re-exports are banned by R9 for functions, and are
  banned here for the same underlying reason: a barrel must state exactly what
  it offers. A star export also silently picks up a value that could become a
  function reference.
- **No functions.** `queries.ts`, `mutations.ts`, `actions.ts`, and
  `workflow.ts` are addressed by path (F3, R8). Re-exporting one through
  `index.ts` creates a second address for it.
- **No cross-domain barrels.** There is deliberately no root `convex/types.ts`
  that re-exports every domain, because it would have to use `export *` and
  would make every domain's interface depend on all the others. A consumer
  imports from the domain it actually depends on:
  `import type { EnrollmentStatus } from "./sequence/index.js"`.

## Recommendations (guidance, not gated)

These are documented judgment calls. The gate does not check them because no
script can evaluate them without understanding intent.

### G1. Only create the files a domain needs
A domain with no external calls has no `actions.ts`; a domain with no
long-lived process has no `workflow.ts`. An empty file created "for symmetry"
is clutter, not structure.

### G2. Prefer fewer, larger domains over many tiny ones
A two-table file does not earn its own directory. Split when a file becomes
hard to navigate (roughly: longer than a screenful of tables, or owned by a
different concern than its neighbours), not before.

### G3. Keep the public surface minimal
Every `query`/`mutation`/`action` is a public API address unless marked
`internal`. Before adding one, check whether an existing function already
answers the question. The cheapest function to maintain is the one that was
never written.

## What the gate enforces

The `check:convex` gate enforces exactly the R-rules that are objectively
checkable without understanding intent:

- every filename under `convex/` (outside `_generated/`, `test/`, any
  extension) is camelCase or a single lowercase word (R1); only
  `convex.config.ts` is matched by exact name, and only at the root (`schema.ts`,
  `http.ts`, and `crons.ts` pass the casing rule on their own and need no
  exemption);
- every directory name under `convex/` (outside `_generated/`) follows the same
  rule (R1);
- table, field, and index names are **not** checked (R2/R3 are documented
  conventions, not automated checks — see their markings);
- root `schema.ts` exists with a default export (R10 — required here because
  this repository uses schema validation);
- a root `http.ts`, when present, default-exports the router; a root
  `crons.ts`, when present, builds its schedule with `cronJobs()`;
- no `export *` in any `convex/` file (R9, R12 — the duplicate-address hazard);
- no `api.*` function references inside `convex/` (R8).

Content checks run against code with comments and string literals stripped, so
a commented-out line or a mention in a string neither flags nor hides a real
violation. The G-rules are never checked: no script can tell whether a domain
deserves its own directory, whether a `model.ts` delegates enough, or whether
a table name is a good noun. Those stay documented here instead.

## Provenance

Every F-rule links to the Convex documentation it comes from. If the framework
changes, the F-rules change with it and the R-rules are re-examined — a
convention that contradicts its framework is a bug in the convention, not in
the framework.
