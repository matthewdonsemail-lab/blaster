/**
 * Outbound send capacity.
 *
 * Telnyx is the only provider Blaster calls from Convex, and it is the only
 * external call here with a throughput ceiling that can be hit by our own
 * behaviour rather than by a bug. Two limits, because there are two separate
 * things to protect:
 *
 *   - `telnyxSend` bounds what the deployment sends in total. This is the
 *     account-level ceiling.
 *   - `telnyxSendPerNumber` bounds what one sending number sends. Telnyx meters
 *     10DLC throughput per campaign, so one busy number must not be able to
 *     spend the whole account's budget; without this, a single number's
 *     enrollment cohort starves every other number on the account.
 *
 * The values are deliberately conservative, and the reason is in this repo's own
 * error handling rather than in Telnyx's documentation: `classifySendResult`
 * treats any 4xx as a definite failure with `retryable: false`, so a provider
 * 429 does not back off, it parks that enrollment for a human. Over-sending
 * therefore does not degrade gracefully, it fails recipients, which is why the
 * cap has to be the thing that prevents the 429 rather than recovering from it.
 * These numbers are the tuning point: raise them once a 429 is classified
 * retryable, and revisit them against the account's real throughput.
 *
 * Token bucket over fixed window because a tick that drains a backlog should be
 * able to burst, and then settle back to the sustained rate, instead of either
 * stalling at a window boundary or sustaining the burst rate forever.
 *
 * Capacity above the rate is what lets an idle number catch up: a number that
 * sent nothing for a minute may spend its accumulated budget at once.

 * a rate that competes with it (convex/pool/utils.ts defaults `minSpacingMs` to
 * this). The bucket admits one send per period per number, so a pool spacing
 * shorter than this only earns a refusal from `claimSendCapacity`, and one
 * exactly equal can sit on the refill boundary. Keeping the two derived from one
 * value is what stops them drifting apart; the limiter stays the authority,
 * because the runner defers when this refuses.

 * Both limits are checked before either is consumed. `limit()` consumes as it
 * evaluates, so consuming the account limit and then finding the per-number limit
 * exhausted would spend a token on a send that never happens, and the shortfall
 * would then throttle real traffic. Checking first costs one extra component
 * call per send and cannot race: the whole thing is one transaction, so nothing
 * can slip between the check and the consumption.
 *
 * A failed claim consumes nothing at all, which is what lets the caller treat a
 * refusal as "not yet" rather than as "this was attempted".
 *
 * Must be called from a mutation or query: the component reads and writes the
 * database, and actions have no `ctx.db`. The runner reaches it through an
 * internal mutation for that reason.
