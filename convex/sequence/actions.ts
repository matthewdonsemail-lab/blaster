/**
 * The sequence runner.
 *
 * This is the only code that sends on a schedule, and it is deliberately thin.
 * Every decision — eligible, quiet hours, claim key, retry ceiling, what an
 * unknown outcome means — belongs to the state machine in packages/core. This
 * file loads rows, asks the machine what to do, performs the one effect it
 * asked for, and reports the result back. A rule that appears here instead of
 * there is a second implementation of the lifecycle, which is the failure mode
 * this design exists to prevent.
 *
 * Why an action and not a mutation: Telnyx is a network call and the SDK uses
 * Node APIs, so this file declares the Node runtime. Mutations are serialisable
 * transactions and must not await the outside world, so every state change a
 * send causes is made through a mutation instead.
 *
 * Claim-before-send is enforced twice, deliberately. `claimStep` decides who
 * owns the step, and the enrollment is re-read immediately after the claim
 * lands: cancellation cannot interrupt an in-flight action, so an enrollment
 * that a reply stopped a moment ago has to be caught before the request is
 * built rather than apologised for afterwards.
 *
 * No type is written inline here. Shapes come from the domain's `types.ts` via
 * its barrel (R11/R12), which is why there is no `as` cast at the call sites
 * below: if a shape is missing, the compiler says so and the fix belongs in one
 * place.
