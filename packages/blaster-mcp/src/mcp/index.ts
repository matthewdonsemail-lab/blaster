/**
 * Blaster MCP server.
 *
 * Built on @modelcontextprotocol/server 2.x, the same generation the Rank MCP
 * server uses. The revision is negotiated by the pinned SDK rather than
 * hardcoded here, so the client and server are tested as a pair.
 *
 * The tool list is derived from one table, and every advertised tool is
 * implemented below. Advertising a tool with no implementation is impossible:
 * the table and the switch are checked against each other at startup.
 *
 * Read-only tools need no credentials. `blaster_send_message` needs Twenty and
 * Telnyx configured, and says so rather than failing obscurely.
