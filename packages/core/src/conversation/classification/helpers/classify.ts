/**
 * Message classification and confidence-gated resolution.
 *
 * Two classifiers share one result shape so they are interchangeable:
 *
 *   - `classifyMessageRules` is the deterministic baseline. It runs with no
 *     key, no network, and no model, which makes it the classifier the tests
 *     and the machine's default input use. Its confidence never reaches the
 *     auto-act ceiling, so a rules-only deployment answers and qualifies but
 *     never books or closes without a human-readable trail.
 *   - `buildJevQuestions` produces the TypeSafe request for Jev (see
 *     `docs/typesafe/primitives/choice.md`): one call, three questions
 *     (`message_state`, `requested_resolution`, `tone`) evaluated in parallel
 *     against the whole transcript as state. It returns plain data rather
 *     than calling the API, because external I/O stays in clients and Convex
 *     actions, never in pure helpers. Wire it to `@typesafe-ai/sdk`
 *     `client.systemOne` once `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is set; the answers drop
 *     straight into `ClassifiedMessage` plus `gateResolution`.
 *
 * `opt_out` is matched by rules first and always wins: suppression is a
 * compliance action, never a model judgment call.
