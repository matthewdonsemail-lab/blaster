/**
 * Derive US state/city data from a phone number, offline.
 *
 * A phone number in this system has two geographic facts that are easy to
 * confuse, and this module keeps them apart:
 *
 * - the **country**, which the number itself carries and `libphonenumber-js`
 *   reads reliably (the dial code), and
 * - the **state and city**, which are NOT carried in the number and are looked
 *   up offline against the `areacodes` table, keyed on the 3-digit area code.
 *
 * US state is a property of the area code, not of the full number: a 215
 * number is a Pennsylvania number whether it is in Philadelphia, Levittown,
 * or anywhere the 215 NPA reaches. `areacodes` is a small MIT dataset
 * (~358 area codes) bundled and read from disk at import, so the lookup is
 * synchronous, needs no network and no API key, and works in every surface.
 *
 * The two libraries compose: `libphonenumber-js` parses, validates, and tells
 * us the country; only when the number is a NANP (US/CA) number do we hand its
 * area code to `areacodes`. Anything else returns structured `null` state so a
 * caller can show "no state known" rather than a wrong one.
 *
 * What `areacodes` does NOT do, and what this module therefore will not claim:
 * - it keys on the 3-digit area code, so an area code that technically spans
 *   two states resolves to its **primary** state, not a set of states.
 * - it does not distinguish mobile from local; both resolve to the NPA's state.
 * - toll-free NPAs (800/833/844/855/866/877/888/899) have no state, so they
 *   resolve to `null` state and are flagged as toll-free.
 *
 * The state/city strings in the raw table are inconsistently cased
 * ("Michigan", "us virgin islands", ...), so this module normalises them to
 * canonical title case before returning, keyed off the USPS code where one
 * exists.
