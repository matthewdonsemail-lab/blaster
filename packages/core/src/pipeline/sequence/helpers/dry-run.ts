/**
 * Driving the enrollment machine for a dry run.
 *
 * The runner will do exactly this and then perform the effect; the only
 * difference is what happens to the `SequenceEffect` the machine leaves behind.
 * A dry run stops at the claim request, because claiming is the runner's job and
 * the runner is what does not exist yet.
 *
 * It lives in core so that the CLI does not need the state library at all. A
 * consumer that wants to know what a tick would do asks this function; how the
 * answer is computed is core's business, and a second implementation of the same
 * transition in a caller is a second set of bugs.
