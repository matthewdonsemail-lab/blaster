/**
 * TCPA quiet hours.
 *
 * Marketing texts may not be sent before 8:00am or after 9:00pm **in the
 * recipient's local time** (47 CFR 64.1200(c)(1)). Three properties of that
 * sentence are the whole reason this is a module:
 *
 *   - *Recipient's* local time. Not the sender's, not the server's. A 9:30pm
 *     Eastern send is already past quiet hours for an East-Coast recipient while
 *     it is only 6:30pm on the West Coast.
 *   - It is a wall-clock window, not an offset. A step whose delay lands at 3am
 *     is a violation no matter how the arithmetic came out.
 *   - Consent is not currently a defence. Since November 2024 a wave of class
 *     actions has alleged quiet-hours violations *even where the recipient
 *     consented*, and the industry's FCC petition arguing that written consent
 *     forecloses the claim is still unresolved. So the window is enforced
 *     unconditionally rather than being something a flag can switch off.
 *
 * The zone comes from the recipient's area code, which `derivePhoneState`
 * already resolves to a US state. Several states sit in more than one zone, and
 * a single zone per state is an approximation; the table below is documented as
 * such and every multi-zone state resolves to the zone covering the largest
 * share of its numbers. Where the answer would be uncertain near an edge the
 * caller is told so it can bias conservative.
 *
 * Not legal advice. Verify against the regulation before relying on a number.
