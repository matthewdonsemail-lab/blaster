/**
 * Sequence building and eligibility.
 *
 * A sequence is a phone number, a campaign, a set of options, and an ordered
 * list of steps. Everything here is a pure function over plain data, so the
 * rules that decide whether a message may go out are tested with no provider,
 * no workspace, and no deployment.
 *
 * Three rules carry the weight, and each exists because the alternative is a
 * message that cannot legally be sent or should not have been:
 *
 *   1. The recipient's jurisdiction decides the messaging profile. A country
 *      with no registered profile is skipped rather than sent from the default,
 *      because the carrier rejects it after Telnyx has already accepted it.
 *   2. A do-not-contact prospect is never sent to, regardless of options.
 *   3. A reply stops the sequence. Continuing to send after a person answers is
 *      the failure that costs a number its reputation.
