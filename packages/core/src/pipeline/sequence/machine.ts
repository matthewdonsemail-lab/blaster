/**
 * The enrollment state machine: one actor per enrolled prospect.
 *
 * The lifecycle is a statechart because the dangerous part of a sequencer is not
 * sending, it is the set of ways a send can go wrong and which of them may be
 * retried. Written as a function that sends, that distinction is a comment. As
 * states it cannot be got wrong:
 *
 *   scheduled  -> evaluating -> claiming -> sending -> sent -> scheduled
 *                    |            |          |
 *                    |            |          +--> ambiguous  (outcome unknown)
 *                    |            +--> ambiguous  (claim held elsewhere)
 *                    +--> scheduled                  (ineligible, or deferred)
 *
 * `ambiguous` is the state that earns the machine. A read timeout after the
 * request was sent leaves you not knowing whether it was accepted, and billing
 * fires at submission, so an ambiguous send must never retry itself. It has no
 * TICK handler at all: the only way out is a RECONCILE, which is a decision
 * about a fact the machine cannot observe.
 *
 * The claim-before-send ordering is structural for the same reason. `claiming`
 * exists as a state so the runner cannot reach `sending` without having
 * presented the deterministic key to a store with a uniqueness constraint, and
 * so a second worker that loses that race is diverted to `ambiguous` rather
 * than sending a duplicate.
 *
 * No I/O happens here. `pendingEffect` in context is the machine's request to
 * the runner, mirroring how the conversation machine hands work to an injected
 * actor. The runner performs the effect and sends the outcome back as an event,
 * which is what lets this whole lifecycle be tested with no provider.
