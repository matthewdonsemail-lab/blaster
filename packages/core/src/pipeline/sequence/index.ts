// Types must be re-exported with `export type`. esbuild cannot tell a type from
// a value in a re-export clause, so it preserves the name and the ESM loader
// rejects it at runtime ("does not provide an export named ..."). tsc elides
// these, so typecheck passes while the server does not boot. Same rule and same
// reason as conversation/classification/index.ts.
